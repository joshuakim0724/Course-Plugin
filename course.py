# NOTE: If you don't need this file, feel free to delete it! It only serves to
#   be a demo of how plugins should be made.
#
#
# Hey there!
#
# This is dummy.py, or the whirlwind tour of what JshBot 0.4.x is about, and
#   how it can be used.
#
# The file demonsrates how to create new commands with standard syntax,
#   as well as shortcuts and help (manual entry).
#
# There is also a demonstration on how get_response() should be used, and how
#   to read a parsed result.
#
# Lastly, there is a small amount of demo code to show off that plugins can
#   define standard events from discord.Client, and they will be called
#   appropriately.
